   Copyright and Licensing Information for CUTS(TM), OASIS, GAME(TM),
   and Pin++(TM).

   CUTS[1], OASIS[7], GAME[8], and Pin++[9] (hereafter referred to as "CUTS 
   software") was authored and copyrighted by James H. Hill[2]. It is a resource 
   of his research group at the Trustees of Indiana University[3] on behalf of
   Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis[4] (henceforth referred
   to as IUPUI), all rights reserved. Since CUTS software is open-source, 
   freely available software, you are free to use, modify, copy, and 
   distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--CUTS software source code and 
   object code produced from the source, as well as copy and distribute 
   modified versions of this software. You must, however, include this 
   copyright statement along with any code built using CUTS software that 
   you release. No copyright statement needs to be provided if you just ship 
   binary executables of your software products.

   You can use CUTS software in commercial and/or binary software releases
   and are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code
   that is built using CUTS software. Note, however, that you may not
   do anything to CUTS software code, such as copyrighting it yourself
   or claiming authorship of the CUTS software code, that will prevent
   CUTS software from being distributed freely using an open-source
   development model. You need not inform anyone that you're using CUTS
   software in your software, although we encourage you to let us[5]
   know so we can promote your project.

   The CUTS web site[1] is maintained by James H. Hill at Department
   of Computer and Information Science at IUPUI[6] for the development
   of open-source software as part of the open-source software community.
   Submissions are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no warranties
   whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability, non-infringement
   of third party intellectual property, or fitness for any particular
   purpose. In no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct,
   indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages,
   including without limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the
   possibility of such damages. LIKEWISE, CUTS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS
   IS WITH NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF DESIGN,
   MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
   OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE. IUPUI,
   THEIR EMPLOYEES, AND STUDENTS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO
   THE INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS OR ANY PATENTS BY CUTS
   SOFTWARE OR ANY PART THEREOF. MOREOVER, IN NO EVENT WILL IUPUI, THEIR
   EMPLOYEES, OR STUDENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE OR PROFITS OR
   OTHER SPECIAL, INDIRECT AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

   CUTS software is provided with no support and without any obligation
   on the part of IUPUI, their employees, or students to assist in its
   use, correction, modification, or enhancement.

   CUTS software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform
   is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, CUTS software is compliant with the new US
   daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of
   2005," which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the
   United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since CUTS software
   obtains time/date and calendaring information from operating systems,
   users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade
   their operating systems accordingly.

   The name CUTS, OASIS, GAME, Pin++, and IUPUI, may not be used to endorse 
   or promote products or services derived from this source without express 
   written permission from IUPUI. This license grants no permission to call 
   products or services derived from this source CUTS nor does it grant 
   permission for the name IUPUI to appear in their names.

   If you have any suggestions, additions, comments, or questions, please
   let me[5] know.
